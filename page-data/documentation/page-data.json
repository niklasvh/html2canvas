It gathers information on all the elements\nthere, which it then uses to build a representation of the page. In other words, it does not actually take a\nscreenshot of the page, but builds a representation of it based on the properties it reads from the DOM.</p>\n<p>As a result, it is only able to render correctly properties that it understands, meaning there are many\nCSS properties which do not work. For a full list of supported CSS properties, check out the\n<a href=\"/features/\">supported features</a> page.</p>\n<h2>Limitations</h2>\n<p>All the images that the script uses need to reside under the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy\">same origin</a>\nfor it to be able to read them without the assistance of a <a href=\"/proxy/\">proxy</a>. Similarly, if you have other <code class=\"language-text\">canvas</code>\nelements on the page, which have been tainted with cross-origin content, they will become dirty and no longer readable by html2canvas.</p>\n<p>The script doesn't render plugin content such as Flash or Java applets.</p>\n<h2>Browser compatibility</h2>\n<p>The library should work fine on the following browsers (with <code class=\"language-text\">Promise</code> polyfill):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Firefox 3.5+</li>\n<li>Google Chrome</li>\n<li>Opera 12+</li>\n<li>IE9+</li>\n<li>Edge</li>\n<li>Safari 6+</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"About","description":"Learn about html2canvas, how it works and some of its limitations","previousUrl":null,"previousTitle":null,"nextUrl":"/getting-started","nextTitle":"Getting Started"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/documentation/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
